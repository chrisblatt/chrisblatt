- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisblatt
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps, Cloud Engineering, Observability, and Reliablity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes, Cloud Engineering fundamentals in Azure, and freshening coding skills after scripting for a long time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to contribute on open source observability and internal development portal/platform solutions but not sure how or where to start.
